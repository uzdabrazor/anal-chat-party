## 🔥 WHAT THE HELL IS THIS THING? 🔥

This is the most **BADASS MULTI-USER CHAT SYSTEM** ever built! Picture this: You want to chat with your local Ollama LLM, but you want to do it from your terminal like a proper hacker **AND** let your normie friends use a slick web interface **AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME**! 🤯

That's exactly what this cyberpunk nightmare does! It's a **multi-interface chat party** that:

- 🧠 **CONNECTS TO OLLAMA** (your local LLM beast)
- 💬 **LETS EVERYONE CHAT** with the same AI simultaneously
- 🌐 **RUNS ON YOUR NETWORK** so the whole crew can join the party
- 📚 **OPTIONALLY DEVOURS DOCUMENTS** with RAG mode for knowledge-based conversations

**The core experience**: Multiple people (CLI warriors + web peasants) all chatting with the same AI in real-time. It's like a group chat but with an AI that actually knows shit! 🔥

## 📸 SCREENSHOTS OF THE CHAOS 📸

Get ready for some visual fucking carnage! Here's what this beautiful disaster looks like in action:

### 🖥️ **CLI Terminal Madness**

![CLI Interface](./assets/cli.png)
_The terminal experience - where real hackers live and breathe_

### 🌐 **Web Interface Glory**

![Web Interface](./assets/webui.png)
_Pretty browser interface for the GUI peasants (but hey, it works!)_

### 🎪 **Multi-User Chaos in Action**

![Multi-User Chat](./assets/chat.gif)
_When everyone's talking to the same AI simultaneously - pure pandemonium!_

## 🎭 THE BASIC MINDFUCK 🎭

### 🖥️ **INTERFACE MADNESS**

- **CLI-ONLY MODE**: Pure terminal experience for the hardcore (`--no-web`) 😎
- **CLI + WEB HYBRID MODE**: Default mode - CLI for you + web interface for friends! 🔥
  - You chat from terminal like a proper hacker
  - Friends join via browser at whatever address you set with `--listen`
  - Everyone talks to the SAME AI simultaneously! 🌐

### 🔮 **OPTIONAL DOCUMENT SORCERY (RAG MODE)**

Want to level up? Add `--rag-dir` and the system scans your document directory, creates a **FAISS vector index** (fancy math shit), and lets the AI pull relevant info from your docs when answering questions. It's like having a super-powered penus librarian who never sleeps and swears like a sailor while rubbing one off! 📖⚡

**But remember**: This is totally optional! The core experience is just pure multi-user chat madness! 🎊

## ⚡ REQUIREMENTS (Don't Skip This Shit!) ⚡

Before you start this beautiful chaos, you need to get your ducks in a fucking row:

### 🦙 **OLLAMA SERVER RUNNING**

This beast needs Ollama serving the API somewhere (default: `localhost:11434`):

```bash
# Install Ollama first (if you haven't already)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start the Ollama service
ollama serve

# Test it's working (should return JSON)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### 🧠 **DOWNLOAD THE FUCKING MODELS**

You need at least these models for the default setup:

```bash
# Default chat model (7GB download, be patient!)
ollama pull dolphin-mistral:7b

# Default embedding model for RAG mode (230MB)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:v1.5

# Verify your models are ready
ollama list
```

### 🌐 **CUSTOM MODELS** (Optional)

Want different models? Pull whatever you want and use `--model` parameter:

```bash
# Some popular alternatives
ollama pull llama3.2:3b        # Smaller, faster
ollama pull codellama:7b       # Code-focused
ollama pull mistral:7b         # Alternative chat model

# Then use with --model parameter
anal-chat-party --model llama3.2:3b
```

### 🐳 **DOCKER** (For the Easy Install)

If you're using the Docker method, you need Docker installed:

```bash
# Check if Docker is installed
docker --version

# If not, install it: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
```

**That's it! Now you're ready for the chaos!** 🔥💀

## 🚀 GETTING THIS BEAST RUNNING 🚀

### 💀 **THE SUPER EASY INSTALL WAY (Docker)**

Want to install this bad boy system-wide? Just grab the Docker wrapper script and you're golden! Or just clone this fuckin' repo and use the bash script from here.

```bash
# Download the script directly from GitHub
curl -o anal-chat-party https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzdabrazor/anal-chat-party/main/anal-chat-party

# Make it executable (because we're not animals)
chmod +x anal-chat-party

# Install it to your system bin so you can run it from anywhere 🔥
sudo mv anal-chat-party /usr/local/bin/

# Now you can run it from ANYWHERE like a boss! 💀
anal-chat-party --listen 0.0.0.0:9000 --rag-dir ~/docs

# Update to the latest version anytime! (just does a git pull for the latest image) 🚀
anal-chat-party update
```

### 🛠️ **THE PYTHON WAY**

```bash
# Install the dependencies like a proper dev
pip install -r requirements.txt

# BASIC CHAT PARTY - Multi-user AI chat! 💕
python main.py

# ADD DOCUMENT POWER - RAG mode activated! 🌈
python main.py --rag-dir /path/to/your/docs

# DEBUG THE CHAOS - See all the technical gore 🔧
python main.py --debug --model mistral:7b

## 🎊 THE COOL SHIT YOU CAN DO 🎊

### 👥 **MULTI-USER CHAOS MODE**

Here's where it gets **ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HILARIOUS**:

- CLI users and web users **ALL TALK TO THE SAME AI** 🤯
- Everyone sees everyone else's messages in real-time
- **Different usernames** so you know who's asking what
- CLI messages show up in web with a 💻 icon
- Web messages show up in CLI with a 🌐 icon
- **ABSOLUTE PANDEMONIUM** when multiple people are asking questions! 😂

Example conversation:

```
💻 [xXx_L33tH4x0r_xXx]: yo how the fuck do I crack this WiFi password?
🤖 AI: Well shit, you could try aircrack-ng with a good wordlist... but maybe don't hack your neighbor's WiFi, you beautiful bastard.

🌐 [Mom]: Honey, how do I download more RAM for my computer?
🤖 AI: Oh sweet mother of silicon, you can't download RAM! It's hardware, not software. Though I appreciate the optimism, you magnificent boomer.

💻 [xXx_L33tH4x0r_xXx]: MOM?! What the actual fuck are you doing here?!
🤖 AI: LMAOOO your mom found the chat! This is better than watching cable TV, you absolute legends.

🌐 [Mom]: Language, young man! Also, why does my computer keep asking if I want hot singles in my area?
🤖 AI: Because the internet thinks you're lonely, Karen. Close those pop-ups and maybe install an ad blocker, for fuck's sake.

💻 [xXx_L33tH4x0r_xXx]: I'm moving out. This is worse than the time she found my browser history.
🤖 AI: Your digital privacy died the moment mom discovered technology. RIP your dignity, soldier.

🌐 [Mom]: What's this "peen goes in vageen" thing I keep seeing on your computer?
🤖 AI: Oh fuck me sideways... Karen, that's... that's just how the internet explains biology. Maybe stick to Facebook, yeah?

💻 [xXx_L33tH4x0r_xXx]: JESUS CHRIST MOM STOP READING MY SHIT
🤖 AI: This chat has officially peaked. I've seen nuclear launches with less chaos than this family reunion.
```

### 🌐 **OFF-GRID NETWORK PARTY**

Deploy this bad boy on your local network and watch the magic happen:

```bash
# Listen on all interfaces with default port
anal-chat-party --listen 0.0.0.0:8000 --rag-dir ~/shared-docs

# Custom port for your network party! 🎉
anal-chat-party --listen 0.0.0.0:9000

# Specific IP for maximum control
anal-chat-party --listen 192.168.1.100:8080

# Now EVERYONE on your network can access:
# http://YOUR_IP:PORT (whatever you set!)
```

**Perfect for**:

- 🏠 **House parties** - let guests interrogate your music collection
- 🏢 **Office deployments** - company knowledge base that everyone can access
- 🎓 **Study groups** - shared research documents with AI help
- 🕵️ **Secret societies** - off-grid knowledge sharing (we won't tell!)

- 📋 **PDFs** - because everything important is a fucking PDF
- 📝 **Word docs** (.docx) - corporate bullshit documents
- 📊 **LibreOffice** (.odt) - for the open source warriors

### 🎨 **CUSTOMIZATION MADNESS**

- **Custom system prompts** - make your AI a pirate, robot, or existential philosopher
- **Multiple models** - switch between different LLMs for different vibes
- **Debug mode** - see the technical guts with beautiful Rich formatting
- **Token management** - handles huge conversations without choking
- **Real-time streaming** - watch the AI think in real-time

### 🔥 **TECHNICAL WIZARDRY UNDER THE HOOD**

- **FAISS vector search** for lightning-fast document retrieval
- **WebSocket real-time sync** between CLI and web
- **Thread-safe message queues** because concurrency is hard
- **Automatic reconnection** when networks are shitty

# Now your whole team can:
# - Ask questions about papers from CLI/web
# - See what others are researching
# - Get AI insights on the literature
# - Laugh at each other's weird questions
```

### 🏴‍☠️ **Hacker Collective Chat**

```bash
# Pure chat mode - just the crew talking to AI
python main.py --system-prompt "You are a cybersecurity expert who speaks like a hacker from the 90s"

# OR supercharge with docs if you want knowledge-based answers
python main.py --rag-dir ~/hacker-docs --system-prompt "You are a cybersecurity expert who speaks like a hacker from the 90s"

# Either way: Web interface for newbies, CLI for the hardcore
```

### 🎮 **Gaming Group Chat**

```bash
# Basic party chat with AI dungeon master
anal-chat-party --name "DungeonMaster" --system-prompt "You are a creative D&D dungeon master"
